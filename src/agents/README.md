# Multi-Agent AI System for Startup Analysis

This directory contains a comprehensive multi-agent system designed for venture capital startup analysis. The system uses specialized AI agents that work together to extract data, analyze different aspects of startups, and make investment decisions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Agent Orchestrator
The `AgentOrchestrator` coordinates all agents and manages the analysis pipeline:
- **Parallel Processing**: Runs multiple agents simultaneously when possible
- **Sequential Coordination**: Ensures data flows correctly between phases
- **Error Handling**: Manages failures and provides fallback mechanisms
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors analysis progress across all agents

### Data Extraction Agents
Specialized agents for different data sources:

#### Document Extraction Agent
- Parses pitch decks, financial statements, and business plans
- Extracts founder information, business models, and financial data
- Uses AI to understand document structure and content

#### Voice Analysis Agent  
- Processes founder interviews and pitch recordings
- Analyzes sentiment, confidence, and key talking points
- Extracts emotional indicators and communication patterns

#### Public Data Agent
- Gathers market intelligence from external sources
- Collects competitor information and funding history
- Analyzes market trends and news sentiment

### Analysis Agents
Four specialized agents for comprehensive evaluation:

#### Founder Analysis Agent
**Scoring Criteria:**
- Experience (30%): Industry background and years of experience
- Education (20%): Academic credentials and institutions
- Track Record (25%): Previous startup experience and outcomes
- Team Complementarity (15%): Skill diversity and role coverage
- Commitment (10%): Dedication and full-time involvement

**Output:**
- Numerical scores for each criterion
- Insights about team strengths
- Red flags and concerns
- Recommendations for team improvement

#### Market Analysis Agent
**Scoring Criteria:**
- Market Size (25%): TAM, SAM, SOM analysis
- Growth Rate (30%): Market expansion and trends
- Competition (20%): Competitive landscape assessment
- Timing (15%): Market readiness and adoption curves
- Accessibility (10%): Barriers to entry and market penetration

**Output:**
- Market opportunity scores
- Trend identification
- Competitive positioning
- Growth projections

#### Business Analysis Agent
**Scoring Criteria:**
- Revenue (25%): Current revenue and monetization
- Growth (30%): Revenue growth rate and trajectory
- Margins (20%): Unit economics and profitability
- Scalability (15%): Business model scalability potential
- Sustainability (10%): Long-term viability and moats

**Output:**
- Business model evaluation
- Financial projections
- Scalability assessment
- Sustainability analysis

#### Risk Analysis Agent
**Risk Categories:**
- Market Risk (30%): Competition, market size, timing
- Team Risk (25%): Experience, commitment, execution capability
- Financial Risk (25%): Burn rate, runway, revenue sustainability
- Technology Risk (20%): Technical feasibility, IP protection

**Output:**
- Risk scores by category
- Risk factor identification
- Mitigation strategies
- Overall risk assessment

### Decision Making Agent
The central decision engine that:
- **Weighted Scoring**: Combines all analysis results using configurable weights
- **Investment Decisions**: Makes INVEST/CONSIDER/PASS recommendations
- **Confidence Metrics**: Calculates confidence levels for decisions
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates overall investment risk
- **Recommendations**: Provides actionable next steps

**Decision Thresholds:**
- INVEST: Overall score ‚â• 75
- CONSIDER: Overall score ‚â• 60
- PASS: Overall score < 60

### Memo Generation Agent
Creates professional investment memos with:
- **Executive Summary**: Key findings and recommendations
- **Investment Thesis**: Core investment rationale
- **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive breakdown by category
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk factors and mitigation strategies
- **Next Steps**: Recommended actions and timeline
- **Appendices**: Supporting data and methodology

## üöÄ Usage Example

```javascript
import MultiAgentSystem from './agents/MultiAgentSystem.js';

// Initialize the system
const multiAgent = new MultiAgentSystem();

// Prepare input data
const inputData = {
  documents: [/* pitch deck files */],
  voiceData: {/* recorded pitch audio */},
  companyName: "Startup Name"
};

// Run analysis with progress tracking
const result = await multiAgent.analyzeStartup(inputData, (message, progress) => {
  console.log(`${message} - ${progress}%`);
});

// Access results
console.log('Investment Score:', result.data.scores.overall);
console.log('Recommendation:', result.data.decision.action);
console.log('Investment Memo:', result.data.memo);
```

## üîß Configuration

### Adjusting Agent Weights
```javascript
// Update decision-making weights
multiAgent.updateAnalysisWeights({
  founder: 0.35,    // Increase founder importance
  market: 0.30,     // Increase market importance  
  business: 0.20,   // Decrease business importance
  risk: 0.15        // Decrease risk importance
});
```

### Custom Thresholds
```javascript
// Modify decision thresholds
const decisionAgent = new DecisionMakingAgent();
decisionAgent.thresholds = {
  invest: 80,    // Higher bar for investment
  consider: 65,  // Higher bar for consideration
  pass: 45       // Lower threshold for passing
};
```
